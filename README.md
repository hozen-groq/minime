# Mini Me: Your Customizable X AI Persona  

A customizable web application inspired by recent design trends that allows you to interact with a virtual characterization of [@ozenhati](https://x.com/ozenhati), Head of Developer Relations at [Groq](https://console.groq.com). Buit using Groq API for text-to-speech and Twitter API for fetching tweets, the character responds to questions based on Twitter data from a specified account and speaks responses using Groq's newly released [text-to-speech model](https://groq.com/build-fast-with-text-to-speech/).

## Overview
This application creates a personalized AI representation based on:
- Your Twitter/X data
- Groq documentation for technical questions
- Custom avatar images with lip-sync capabilities (images can be generated using ChatGPT or Google AI Studio until Groq hosts image gen models)

The avatar responds to questions in real-time using:
- Llama 3.3 70B via Groq API for generating answers
- Dialog 1.0 via Groq for text-to-speech/natural voice responses
- Animated mouth movements that are the result of combining a few images with different facial expressions generated by AI 

### Customization Guide
#### Replacing the Avatar
Create Your avatar images:
- Generate base cartoon/avatar images using OpenAI's 4o for image generation or similar
- Create mouth movement variations using Google AI Studio (worked well for me and I recommend it for precise mouth edits)
- You'll need 4 images with different mouth positions for lip-sync

Prepare your images:
- Name your images consistently (e.g., avatar_frame_1.png, avatar_frame_2.png, avatar_frame_3.png, and avatar_frame_3.png)
- Place them in the `client/src/images/` directory to replace already existing images

#### Using Your Own Twitter/X Data
- In `server/.env`, change `TWITTER_USERNAME` to your Twitter/X handle (without the @ symbol)
- In `client/.env`, update `REACT_APP_TWITTER_USERNAME` to the same
- In `server/services/groqResponseService.js`, customize the prompts to your liking
- Customize or remove `server/services/groqDocsService.js` since it's specific to Groq documentation (or leave as is to let your mini me be a Groq expert too!)

#### Customizing Voice
- In `client/.env`, update `REACT_APP_TTS_VOICE` to your preferred [Groq TTS voice](https://console.groq.com/docs/text-to-speech)

#### Customizing App Title
- In `client/src/App.js`, change text of <TrueNeumorphicTitle text="head of groq relations" /> to title of your choice (line 205)


### Limitations
- Currently only supports text inputs (no voice input)
- Responses are based primarily on Twitter data and may not capture all nuances/may not be accurate
- Mouth animation is simplified and uses predefined positions rather than advanced lip-sync

### Future Enhancements

- Voice input capabilities
- More advanced lip-sync animation
- Integration with additional data sources
- Support for multi-turn conversations with memory

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- [Twitter API Bearer Token](https://developer.x.com/en)
- [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/keys)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hozen-groq/mini-me.git
   cd mini-me
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the server directory
   - Copy `client/.env.example` to `client/.env`
   - Fill in your Twitter Bearer Token and Groq API Key

## Development

Run both client and server in development mode:
```
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- Audio files are automatically cleaned up after a configurable period (default: 1 hour)
- Twitter data is cached to minimize API calls (the limits for the X API are extremely brutal)
- Groq documentation is cached and used to answer API-related questions (you can probably replace this with another source or remove entirely since the logic is based on Groq documentation)
